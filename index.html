              <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To recognize legacy companies and their shared history
                 within the context of American history and share current stories
                 the highlight the work of Duke Energy employees.

               <p class="bigp">I worked on the conception and design of the interactive touchscreen
                 wall in the lobby of one of the Duke Energy corporate headquarters
                 buildings in Charlotte, NC.
               </p>
               <p class="bigp">Through initial research and conversations with employees, we
                 found that several of the current Duke Energy employees came from
                 acquisitions and mergers. Furthermore, older employees who are
                 retiring in the next few years will be replaced by a younger population
                 with no knowledge of this company history.
               </p>
               <p class="bigp">The interactive wall is part of an internal exhibit that highlights 180 years
                 of Duke Energy and legacy company history, serving to educate and
                 reflect upon the events of the past. The interactive wall includes
                 a shared timeline, company trivia, and current employee highlights.

           <p class="bigp">Working with historians at Mississippi State University,
             I designed a series of 6 interactives that let visitors learn about
             the character of President Ulysses S. Grant and draw their own conclusions
             of the Union general and president, in the context of the south.</p>

                stories are reflected in this interactive. Their memories live on
