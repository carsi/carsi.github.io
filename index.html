   <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p>I am a North Carolina native with experience designing for public
     institutional, corporate, and government settings. I am well versed
     in design systems, brand storytelling, and  learning/motivation strategies.
   </p>

   <p>In my free time, I throw functional pottery, bake sourdough bread, and
     practice Iyengar Yoga. I am currently addicted to solving crossword puzzles.
   </p>

    <h2>Work Samples</h2>
      <p>I currently design large scale interactive touchscreen experiences
        at LKC Creative in Raleigh, North Carolina.

      <h2>Design Strategy &amp; Process</h2>
      <p>I use design thinking methods and storytelling to make a compelling case
        for users. Working closely with project managers and content experts, I
        am able to leverage their knowledgeto co-create interactive experiences
        that serve the everyday person.
      </p>

        <p><i>Typical steps in my design process:</i></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Initial research on the subject matter and users</li>
          <li>Design strategy to align with the vision of the organization</li>
          <li>User experience design to determine user needs and motivations</li>
          <li>Ideation, including design methods and sketching wireframes</li>
          <li>High fidelity user interface design</li>
          <li>Testing through prototyping</li>
        </ol>
