    <h2>Work</h2>
      <p class="bigp">I currently design large scale interactive touchscreen experiences
        at LKC Creative in Raleigh, North Carolina. Here are a few highlights:

              <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To recognize legacy companies and their shared history
                 within the context of American history and share current stories
                 the highlight the work of Duke Energy employees.

               </a>
               <p class="bigp">I worked on the conception and design of the interactive touchscreen
                 wall in the lobby of one of the Duke Energy corporate headquarters
                 buildings in Charlotte, NC.
               </p>
               <p class="bigp">Through initial research and conversations with employees, we
                 found that several of the current Duke Energy employees came from
                 acquisitions and mergers. Furthermore, older employees who are
                 retiring in the next few years will be replaced by a younger population
                 with no knowledge of this company history.
               </p>
               <p class="bigp">The interactive wall is part of an internal exhibit that highlights 180 years
                 of Duke Energy and legacy company history, serving to educate and
                 reflect upon the events of the past. The interactive wall includes
                 a shared timeline, company trivia, and current employee highlights.

           <p class="bigp">Working with historians at Mississippi State University,
             I designed a series of 6 interactives that let visitors learn about
             the character of President Ulysses S. Grant and draw their own conclusions
             of the Union general and president, in the context of the south.</p>

              <p>A media piece that recognizes Hall of Fame Inductees and tells

              <p>NC State has won the Men’s Basketball National Championships twice
              in its athletic history: once in 1974 with head coach Everett Case
              and again in 1983 with head coach Jim Valvano. This interactive shows
              the path to both success stories.

              <p>If you have ever heard of NC State’s athletics, you have probably
                heard of legendary basketball coaches Jim Valvano and Kay Yow. Both
                coaches are well respected not only for their athletic achievements
                but for their impact on the NC State community. Their respective
                stories are reflected in this interactive. Their memories live on
                in their speeches and foundations to fund cancer research.
