       </a>
       <p class="bigp">I worked on the conception and design of the interactive touchscreen
         wall in the lobby of one of the Duke Energy corporate headquarters
         buildings in Charlotte, NC.
       </p>
       <p class="bigp">Through initial research and conversations with employees, we
         found that several of the current Duke Energy employees came from
         acquisitions and mergers. Furthermore, older employees who are
         retiring in the next few years will be replaced by a younger population
         with no knowledge of this company history.
       </p>
       <p class="bigp">The interactive wall is part of an internal exhibit that highlights 180 years
         of Duke Energy and legacy company history, serving to educate and
         reflect upon the events of the past. The interactive wall includes
         a shared timeline, company trivia, and current employee highlights.
       </p>
       <p><strong>Role:</strong> Design strategy, user experience, and user interface design</p>
